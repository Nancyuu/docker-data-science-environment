# Data

Be aware that GitHub is not designed for large data files. As of January 2023, [GitHub will warn you about files larger than 50MB and does not allow files larger than 100MB at all](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#file-size-limits). They also [recommend that your entire repository be no larger than 5GB](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#repository-size-limits).

If your project contains large data files that you do not wish to or cannot add to GitHub, you should add those files to the `.gitignore` file in the `data/` directory. [Find out more about `.gitignore` files on Git's documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
